// [] turn in assignment to jobs@trifinlabs.com
// [] email subject - Technical Interview Assignment - Shea Parrott
// [] post link to GitHub repo in email body

// [] create boxes that hold events for the days - one week worth
// [] Should only have one event running at the same time?
// [] validate all entries
// [] make all entries CRUD - create, read, update, delete
// [] event object {event: “ “, date: MMDDYY, time: 0:00, isWeekend: bool }
// [] display blocks for available events. Will probably do this in 30 min intervals
// [] make visual difference for weekend boxes

// push goals - optional
// [] toggle between week and day views
// [] theme appointments by color
// [] request confirmations before deleting event

// notes:
// no restriction on data model. Make sure to optimize complexity when accessing record entries
